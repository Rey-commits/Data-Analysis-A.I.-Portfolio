                                Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling 
                                data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and 
                                supporting decision-making. The data analysis tools that i often use are Python 
                                modules such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and SQL. For scientific computations, 
                                i also use Octave, Scilab and MatLab.

                                Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes

                                The subset of Artificial Intellgence includes in my projects are 
                                Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Most of these projects are focusing on detecting or 
                                predicting diseases in medical images. I mainly use TensorFlow, Keras, and
                                PyTorch for most of my projects.

                                Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; itâ€™s the work that 
                                happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well 
                                with a seamless user experience. I mainly focus on the front-end development where 
                                i use React JS as my JavaScript framework and other CSS frameworks such as React-Bootstrap.
